            <h2>About BMI</h2>
            <p>
                BMI, developed by Adolphe Quetelet in the 19th century, is a tool used to categorize weight as underweight, ideal, overweight, or obese, serving as a screening method for health risks. An abnormal BMI, as noted by WHO, increases the likelihood of health issues such as cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, diabetes, and premature death. Understanding and monitoring BMI is crucial to maintaining a healthy weight and minimizing the risk of related health complications. How about you? Let's calculate now using the BMI Calculator!
